Caveats to rule triggers:
- each rule 3x per movie maximum
- rules cannot consecutively trigger
- rules can only trigger once per scene

Special start-of-movie rules, drink if the movie opens with a:
- spaceship
- star-wars text scroll
- voiceover
- "distant future year" that has already passed

The definition of "drink" includes smoking something, or drinking water if you're tapped out.
